        <h1>STOCK MARKETS</h1><br>
        <p id="into">
            Stock markets are a platform where a company issues its shares to the general public to expand its business.
            Stock markets give a chance to a common man to invest in huge reputed companies. It also helps in preventing
            the occurrence of a shortage of funds for the businesses. The stock market came into existence in the year
            1602 by the Dutch East India Company in Amsterdam that replaced the loan borrowing system in many other
            companies. Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered to be the first stock exchange in the world. If it hadn’t
            been for stock markets, we may have never got to see the success of Dhirubhai Ambani who is the founder of
            Reliance, and M.H. Hasham Premji who is the founder of Wipro. To invest in these share markets, we need to
            open a Demat a/c. This can be done by registering in any one of the 300+ stock brokerage firms that are
            currently registered in India. The amount the company shares with its shareholders from the profit it earns
            generally for a year is known as a <Span class="attention">Dividend</Span>. The Board of Directors of the
            respective companies decides
            whether it has to give dividends to its shareholders or not because distributing the dividend is not a
            compulsory task. It depends on the level of profit and various other standards. The companies who are
            willing to give a dividend to the holders under their shares in firm may either give money annually,
            semi-annually or maybe quarterly whereas the firms who do not give dividends immediately reinvest the amount
            of dividend in the company itself. E.g., Reliance Industries Limited, Infosys, and Wipro have been regular
            over the years when it comes to giving dividends while D-mart has never given any dividends to date. It is
            necessary to note that we can’t judge any company on basis of its dividend. Higher dividends never make a
            company a better one just like lower dividends never prove the lower standards of a company. There are times
            when there is an over-subscription of shares or the value of a single share reaches a higher value. During
            these times, a company generally <Span class="attention">splits shares</Span> into no. equal parts. For eg.
            In
            August 2020, Eicher motor’s
            single share cost Rs.22190 which was split into 10 equal parts of Rs.2219 each. This enabled common
            investors to purchase the shares despite their higher prices. Again, it’s not compulsory for every company
            to split its shares. For Eg. MRF , one of India's biggest tire manufacturing companies right now, has its
            share valued at Rs. 82,000 today which was once valued at Rs. 11 in 1993; Similarly, the shares of Berkshire
            Hathway owned by Warren Buffet have shares valued at $3,95,000 (Rs. 2.08 crore), but yet they haven’t split
            their shares yet. A higher or lower share price never decides how big or wealthy a company is. The <a
                href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp">Market
                Capitalisation</a> of a company decides whether it is small or big.

            <p class="secsubtag text-small" style="color: black; ">Following the market capitalization, all the
                companies are divided into three parts, namely –
                <u>Large Cap Companies</u>
                <u>Mid Cap Companies</u>
                <u>Small Cap Companies</u>.
                The companies whose market capitalization is more than 1 lakh crore are known as Large Cap Companies.
                These companies have well financial backups. Mid Cap companies are those companies whose market
                capitalization lies between 20,000 and 1 lakh crore whereas there are companies whose market
                capitalization is below 20,000 which are collectively known as Small Cap Companies. ICICI Bank is a
                large-cap company with a market capitalization of 5139.12 billion whereas Bandhan bank has a market
                capitalization of 53,864.01 Crore and is thus a Mid Cap Company.

            <p class="sectag text-big" style="color: black;"> The concept of Penny Stocks</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small" style="color: black; "><b>Penny Stocks</b> refer to those companies whose
                market
                capitalization is less than 1000 crores. The share prices of these companies are generally low and fall
                under Rs.20 - Rs.30. Videocon and Sintex Industries Limited are examples of Penny Stocks. These
                companies are either already bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy; thus, we should avoid investing in
                these companies. We must also avoid investing in the companies even though it gives regular dividends
                because there are high chances that we may suffer loss even after adding the dividend and the current
                price of the share. This is because the company fails at its performance over the years which results in
                the fall in share price although of its regular dividends. The up-downs that occur in the market affect
                market capitalization up to some extent.<br>

            <p class="sectag text-big" style="color: black;">Initial Public Offering (IPO)</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small" style="color: black; ">Initial Public Offering (IPO) occurs when a company
                receives money from the general public for the first time to expand its business and write off loans. An
                IPO is considered to be a primary market as there is the direct involvement of the companies and people
                and the stock exchange is known as a secondary market because shares are sold and purchased by third
                parties preventing the direct involvement of the companies and people. For this purpose, the company
                hires some investment banks which help them in the process of IPO and the company also prepares their
                DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) which consists of the valuable information about the company such as
                products and services, details about the founder and management, risk and rewards, etc. SEBI is the
                regulator of stock markets in India and it has the power to give or reject approval of IPO to any
                company. The DRHP has to be submitted to the SEBI and then it approves the company unless it requires
                some additional information about it. As soon as a company receives approval for an IPO it immediately
                decides the IPO date and price band. </p><br>

            <p class="sectag text-big" style="color: black;"> Types of IPO and Profit earning methods</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small" style="color: black; ">There are two types of companies depending upon the
                price they decide to issue their IPO, they are- <u>Fixed Price IPO</u> and <u>Book Building IPO</u>.
                Fixed Price IPO
                refers to the fixed price of an IPO whereas Book Building IPO refers to the range of price of an IPO.
                You cannot buy 1 or 2 shares in IPO instead you have to purchase them in lots as decided by the
                respective companies. No matter how many shares you subscribe for an IPO, the company will first ensure
                that every holder is at least getting one lot. As long as there is no over-subscription of shares, there
                stands a possibility of getting multiple lots in IPO. Profits can be earned in two ways – <u>Listing
                    Gains</u>
                and <u>Long-term Profits</u>. Listing gains refer to the selling of shares on the same day on which it
                is
                listed on the stock exchange. The majority of people prefer listing gains because in the last 10 years
                all the IPO have emerged, and all of them have given 8.71% of listing gain. Long-term profit refers to
                holding the shares in IPO for the long term.
